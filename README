# Overview
_NOTE_ Guaranteed to compile and link on OSX/macOS. This code will most likely compile on *nix-like environments, but will not link due to macOS framework dependencies

This library is a 2d game engine, developed in C, that only requires OpenGL. 

This game engine is designed to be bare bones, focusing more on simplicity than advanced feature sets.
As such, most features require some custom code to actually be useful. A very basic example game is provided
to both prove the game engine basically works and to show how to get the game engine running in C code.


My primary motivations for creating this game engine are:
* To practice C programming and learn its features and limitations, mostly compared to C++
* To learn the basics of OpenGL and how to better integrate external APIs
* To learn how to manage a relatively large code base in terms of compiling co-related projects.

# Compilation
Install XCode developer tools. A quick google search should reveal how to do this.

## Game Engine
In the terminal run
```
cd _game engine directory_
make build
```

The library will be compiled to _game engine directory_/bin/libGameEngine.a

## Unit Tests
This make recipe compiles and runs the unit tests for the game engine library.
Results are sent to stdout.

In the terminal run
```
cd _game engine directory_
make runTest
```

## Example Game
To run the example game provided, perform the following steps:

Install the following libraries:
* libiconv
* libSDL2 
* libc
* libpng

In the terminal run
```
cd _game engine directory_
make buildGame
bin/gameWithAnAwesomeName.out
```

Controls are 
* `A`: moves the paddle left
* `D`: moves the paddle right
